A basic Face Recognition Application made with opencv and tkinter.It uses Haarcascade method for face detection.It uses *cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()*
from opencv-contrib-python for recognition of faces.It calculates the confidence value and shows that values on the webcam window

# How to build:
## Pycharm setup:

Install python and then create a new project in pycharm.Place Faces.py and Faces-train.py in your project directory.Add the required modules i.e opencv-python,
pillow, opencv-contrib-python etc in the project interpreter.
